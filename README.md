# What I have learned

Whit this project I have learned the fundamentals of JavaScript Classes for creating objects and Prototypes. I learned about constructor() function, he underscore "_" identifier used to preface the name of an object's property or method that is private. Among other things, I was introduced to Navigator API as part of the web APIs and Geolocation. For the need of the project, I become familiar with fetching current position latitude and longituted with help of Google Maps API and the browser.

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

Most challenging part was creating and applying classes and private object's properties. But the MDN documentation helped me a lot to understand them along with the Web API.
